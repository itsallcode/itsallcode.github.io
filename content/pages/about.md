`itsallcode.org` — as the name suggests — is a group of software enthusiasts with a special fondness for treating everything as code. From actual programs over infrastructure to builds and documentation.

We are the authors of the requirement tracing suite [OpenFastTrace](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace). This platform independent software can trace requirements from your specifications all the way down to your implementation, tests and handbooks.
