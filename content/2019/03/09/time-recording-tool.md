To keep track of my working time I wrote a small time recording tool called White Rabbit. You can find it at [https://github.com/itsallcode/white-rabbit](https://github.com/itsallcode/white-rabbit).

# Features

- Simple text user interface
- Records begin, end and interruption of your working day
- Data storage in human-readable json files, one file per month
- Manual interruptions: press `i` to start and stop interruptions
- Supports weekend, public holiday, vacation, flex time and sickness (see json example)
- Reporting of total overtime: press `r`
- Automatic update in the background (press `u` to update manually): just keep it running and it will record your working time
    - Start of work is detected via
        - Program start
        - Computer resumes from sleep in the morning
    - End of work is detected via
        - Program shutdown
        - Computer sleeps for the rest of the day
- Interruptions added when computer sleeps for more than 2 minutes
- Assumptions:
    - Working time of 8h Monday to Friday
    - Mandatory break of 45 minutes after 6 hours of working

# Architectural descisions

The architecture separates business logic (sub-project logic) from the user interface (textui). This allows you to add additional user interfaces e.g. using JavaFX or Swing.

We use JSON for storage because this enables the user to manually make changes (e.g. add a sick day).Â  So we can keep the user interface as simple as possible.

# Example data file

```json
{
    "year": 2019,
    "month": "MARCH",
    "days": [
        {
            "date": "2019-03-01",
            "begin": "08:00:00",
            "end": "17:00:00",
            "comment": "First working day (type WORK is optional)"
        },
        {
            "date": "2019-03-04",
            "type": "VACATION",
            "comment": "Vacation day, no change to working time"
        },
        {

            "type": "FLEX_TIME",

        }
    ]
}
```
