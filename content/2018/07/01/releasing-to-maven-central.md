While we already published releases on [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter), we are now in the process of getting [OpenFastTrace](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace) published on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/). The goal is of course to make using OFT as convenient as possible for everyone.

I am happy to see that the people from Maven Central take security seriously and do not just let anyone publish modules under any package name. They asked us to prove that we own the domain “itsallcode.org”, so that gave me the necessary kick in the butt to speed up my plan to set up a web presence for OFT outside of Github on our domain. This blog is the first part.
