Today Christoph and me released version [1.1.0](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace/releases/tag/1.1.0) of [OpenFastTrace](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace). The most notable feature addition is that you now can opt to keep specification items without tags when configuring the tag filter.
