Starting today we will provide a growing set of [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) templates to help speed-up writing [OpenFastTrace](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace) specifications using the Eclipse IDE. Using these templates also has the nice side-effect of reducing the chance for errors when writing specifications.
