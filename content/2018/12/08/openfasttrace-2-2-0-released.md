Today we released [OpenFastTrace 2.2.0](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace/releases/tag/2.2.0). As the main new feature the HTML report now shows a trace summary and a small table-of-contents.

Additionally, we focused the [README](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace/blob/master/README.md) on GitHub on OFT users rather than developers and move the developer topics to the new [developer guide](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace/blob/master/doc/developer_guide.md).
