Today we started a new project for creating a [Maven plugin for OpenFastTrace](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace-maven-plugin). This will allow you to trace requirements not only with the command line and Gradle but also with Maven!

The project is still in its early stage but you can already trace requirements with the default configuration and a first integration test is working. See [Pull Request #1](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace-maven-plugin/pull/1) for the current sources. Reviews are welcome!
