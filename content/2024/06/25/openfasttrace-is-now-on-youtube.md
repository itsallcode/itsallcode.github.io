[Itsallcode.org is on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@itsallcode-org) now! 

Check out our three-and-a-half minute [quick-introduction to OpenFastTrace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlzMT6RaVWA).

If you have a little bit more time you can also watch the [presentation we prepared for the Xen Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2o_swwQTNE).

We also talk about rocket science. :-)
