[Version 4.0.0 of OpenFastTrace](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace/releases/tag/4.0.0) marks an important milestone for us. We now have reStructuredText support, which is something that Python users have been waiting for quite a while now.

For more awesome new features check out the [release letter](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace/releases/tag/4.0.0).

As you might know we use semantic versioning, so there is also a breaking change. While earlier version ran with Java 11, Version 4 requires Java 17 to run.
