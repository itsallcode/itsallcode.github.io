Not much time today, so just a list of “features” I’ve discovered on my shiny new Samsung M2825 printer.
<!--more-->

* HTTP but no HTTPS (admittedly most devices do that since there is the problem of how to start the certificate chain)
* Default user / password: “admin” / “sec00000”
* No mention of open HTTP server in installation manual
* No mention in handbook
* Shipped with firmware from 2015
* Firmware update dialog does not indicate that new firmware is available
* Firmware update via file upload from PC – not convenient
* Ton of protocols switched on by default
* HTML Handbook broken (text only) after unpacking
* Firmware well-hidden on the support page (unfold and scroll down):

    (edit 2018-07-01: this link not available anymore)
* Password cut after 18 characters (no indication when entering new password)
* Offers to select source IP for login (probably intended to improve “security”)

**tl;dr:**

Another example that “S” stands for security in IOT.
