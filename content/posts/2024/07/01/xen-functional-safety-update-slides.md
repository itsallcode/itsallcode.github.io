Michal Orzel and Ayan Kumar Halder from AMD published their presentation "[Xen Functional Safety â€” Update](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/using-xen-hypervisor-for-functional-safety/269563052)" from the Xen Summit 2024.

It's an interesting read.

They talk about how OpenFastTrace helps in their documentation process on slide 20.
