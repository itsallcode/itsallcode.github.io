Big shout out to our friend Ayan Kumar Halder, who held a [talk with me on the Xen Summit](https://xenprojectsummit2024.sched.com/event/1bCFL/implementing-requirement-traceability-in-the-xen-fusa-project-with-openfasttrace-ayan-kumar-halder-amd-sebastian-bar-exasol). Ayan talked about traceability in the Xen functional safety project and I contributed a video explaining how OFT fits into the picture.

Watch the [recording of the](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlU1wFeszUM&pp=ygUVeGVuIGZ1bmN0aW9uYWwgc2FmZXR5) talk on the Xen YouTube channel!
