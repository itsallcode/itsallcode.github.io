In a recent blog post I wrote about the [migration from JUnit4 to JUnit5](../30/on-refactoring-an-hidden-technical-dept.md) as unit testing framework.

Even though the version number increase from 2.0.1 to [2.0.2](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace/releases/tag/2.0.2) might not look like much, it is in fact a major milestone for [OpenFastTrace](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace), since from here on writing tests will be faster and more efficient.
