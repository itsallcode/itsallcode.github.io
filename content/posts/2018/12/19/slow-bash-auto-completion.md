Today I found a nice [hint on a Cygwin forum on how to debug slow Bash auto-completion](http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2010-07/msg00516.html):

```bash
set -vx
```

What that does is that it make all the steps visible that the completion uses to come to a result.Â  No you just have to look if one sticks out especially.
