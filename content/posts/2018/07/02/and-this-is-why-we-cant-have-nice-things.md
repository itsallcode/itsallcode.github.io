The option to allow anyone to register to your [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) blog is basically useless and should be removed. The reason why I am saying this is that once the automated spambots find your blog, they start registering users in the hopes of using your blog as a spam distribution platform.

You can use [CAPTCHAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) as a gatekeeper to your registration dialogs. But the fact alone that this is necessary angers me. Just because a bunch of rightfully underpaid software engineering dropouts thinks it is a good idea to support the spam industry, the rest of us have a harder and harder time using the Internet for something useful.

I hope that later generations will look back at this advertise-any-crap-anywhere madness with mild amusement telling themselves that we were a bunch of brainwashed consumers who just didnâ€™t know better.

You there, spambot programmer you proved that you at least know the basics of software development, make something useful out of that and improve your karma.
