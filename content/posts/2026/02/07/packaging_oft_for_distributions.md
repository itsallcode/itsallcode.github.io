Our next goal is to get OFT packaged for easier installation. We will start with Debian and RPM packages soon. Ultimately, we would like to get OFT shipped with the popular distributions. This will probably help with the adoption. But until that happens, it will be a long way.

By the way, if you read this and are a curious developer with experience in the Apple ecosystem, we are looking for help with packaging OFT for macOS. If you are interested, please reach out to us.

The same goes for Windows packaging. We are a bunch of Unix nerds and could use some help in that area.
